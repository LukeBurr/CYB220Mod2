The given file is my final for our programming class.
When the file is opened and ran in pycharm (and should work in other OS as well), 
It should then ask for a master password and reveal password
The program should create a config.json file for the reveal and master password
All provideed passwords for websites should be stored in the passwords.txt file that will be created once a password is set.
Follow the information that appears when the code is ran to get it to work properly.
